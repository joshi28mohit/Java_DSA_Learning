/*
-  ðŸ”„ Reversing an array using the two-pointer method involves swapping elements at the start and end, gradually moving towards the center until they meet.
-  ðŸ”„ The loop for array reversal continues until the start pointer is less than the end pointer, ensuring all elements are correctly swapped.
-  ðŸ”„ The two-pointer method works for arrays of both even and odd lengths, providing an efficient way to reverse the array elements.
-  ðŸ¤“ The two-pointer method is a foundational concept for more advanced array manipulations, such as rotation, Armstrong numbers, and palindromic arrays.
-  ðŸ”— Future sessions will delve into solving array-related questions, exploring topics like array rotation, Armstrong numbers, palindromic arrays, and more.
